# whitepaper
The original Pixelcash whitepaper.
TL;DR: The currency is based on JPEG image compression, i.e. each sub unit (jpenny) is a compressable JPEG image naturally sourced from the billions of images on the web, as opposed to being sourced from an artificial algorithm like pretty much every other coin or token. The images are compressed each time they're spent, gradually lowering the resolution until they cannot be compressed any further and are "worn out" and deleted from circulation, synonymous with paper money becoming worn out. Supply is not fixed but the system keeps it proportional to the user base by design, as the currency is intended to have a natural scarcity as opposed to a hard coded scarcity. Smart contract implementation, unique mining scheme, anonymous currrency; Pixelcash.
