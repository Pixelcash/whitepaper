TL;DR: The currency is based on JPEG image compression, i.e. each sub unit (jpenny) is a compressable JPEG image embedded into the protocol. The images are compressed each time they're spent, gradually lowering the resolution until they cannot be compressed any further and are "worn out" and deleted from circulation, synonymous with paper money becoming worn out. Circulating supply is not fixed but the system keeps it proportional to the user base by design. Smart contract capability is another feature.
